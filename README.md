- 👋 Hi, I’m @aecheon
- 👀 I’m interested in trailing edge electronics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ways to use modern electronics and crafts to re-create obsolete devices, actual and non-existent.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CRTs, NTSC, old wooden cabinets, Arduinos, modules, high voltage, odd light bulbs, film sets, and art nouveau.
- 📫 How to reach me; rlh@usa.net
- 😄 Pronouns: He
- ⚡ Fun fact: Imagination drives clever re-purposing.
